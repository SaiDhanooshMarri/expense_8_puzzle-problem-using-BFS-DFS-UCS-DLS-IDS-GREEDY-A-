# expense_8_puzzle-problem-using-BFS-DFS-UCS-DLS-IDS-GREEDY-Astar-


This codes runs on Python environment and need python 3 installed in the system
To execute the 8 puzzle problem code
steps:
1. open Command Prompt
2. Locate to this folder
3. Enter in following pattern
        >python expense_8_puzzle.py <start file> <goal file> <Algorithm> <Dump file needed: True or False>
For example:
        >python expense_8_puzzle.py start.txt goal.txt a* True

        >python expense_8_puzzle.py start.txt goal.txt dfs 
You can also leave the Dump file needed Column empty if not required.

>Output is printed in command Prompt
>Fringe and closed lists are appened to dump file which is created by each algorithm in their respective Dump folders with code executed date and time.
>Enter the code of algoritm with respective below
    bfs - Breadth First Search
    ucs - Uniform Cost Search
    dfs - Depth First Search
    dls - Depth Limited Search 
    ids - Iterative Deepening Search 
    greedy - Greedy Seach
    a* - A* Search

Note: Time taken for UCS and dfs is more so please wait until the code is completed or can check the Dump file by terminating the code
